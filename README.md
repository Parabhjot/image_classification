# Image Classification on Noisy Labels using Robust Loss Functions  
This script was created for McMaster's CAS 771 course by Parabhjot Deol and Xuanyu Liu  

Objective: Image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using the PyTorch library with loss functions robust to training on data with noisy labels  

Resources: Robust loss functions are implemented from research, references are included in the attached report
