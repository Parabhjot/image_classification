# Image Classification on Noisy Labels using Robust Loss Functions  
This script was created for McMaster's CAS 771 course  
Image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using the PyTorch library with loss functions robust to training on data with noisy labels  
Robust loss functions are implemented from research, references included in the attached report
